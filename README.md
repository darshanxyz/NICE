# NICE
NICE stands for Natural Interpreted Computer English. It is an interpreter written in C language that understands normal English. Moreover, it is inspired from Python. So, it doesn't rely on punctuations! 

This was a group project done by Pragadeesh C, Muthu Naaraayanan and myself in the year 2015 at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore.
